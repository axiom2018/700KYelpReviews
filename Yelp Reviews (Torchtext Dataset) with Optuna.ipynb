You'll regularize too hard. Weights \n    will be small, underfitting happens. Penalty soft? You won't regularize much, weights will go unpunished \n    and overfitting still occurs.\" \n    \n    With that said, how much to regularize is tricky. The expected values are 0.1 to 0.001 but don't bank\n    on that. Remember the smaller the punishment, the more regular overfitting occurs.

If variance is the issue, then the weights \n        are ALREADY high. Last thing needed is the squared weights to make them higher.\"\n    \n    2) Lambda - \n        The lambda value effects the implact of L1. If anyone reading this decides to have a go and mess around with the code, feel free to use different \n        values. Maybe bigger, maybe smaller. I admit I have a preconceived notion that regularization would impact results at the same rate no matter what.\n        I'm very glad taking on this project has given me the realization that the notion was HORRIFICALLY wrong.\n        \n    3) Optuna -\n        Optuna obviously tunes hyperparameters of a model and I just used it for a new lambda which is fine.
